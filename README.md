## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
To run this project, you need to have **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed. Here’s how:

1. **Download Node.js**:
   - Go to [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and download the **LTS version**. This version includes both Node.js and npm.

2. **Install Node.js**:
   - Open the downloaded installer and follow the instructions. This will install both Node.js and npm.

3. **Verify the Installation**:
   - Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, or Terminal on macOS/Linux).
   - Run the following commands to ensure Node.js and npm are installed:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
   - You should see version numbers for both. If you don’t, try restarting your terminal, or if needed, restart your computer.

### Step 2: Clone the Project from GitHub
You’ll need to make a local copy of the project on your computer.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Run this command to clone the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/noman-faraz-islamic/eemaan-up
Navigate into the project folder:
```bash
cd eemaan-up/react-basic-quiz
```
Step 3: Install Project Dependencies
Once you’re in the project folder, install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
npm install
```
This command will download and set up all the required libraries.

Step 4: Start the Development Server
To see the project in action, run:

```bash
npm start
```
This command will start the development server, and it should automatically open a new browser tab with the app running.
If it doesn’t open automatically, you can manually open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
Step 5: Stopping the Development Server
When you’re done, you can stop the server by returning to the terminal where npm start was running and pressing Ctrl + C on your keyboard.
